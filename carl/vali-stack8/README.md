# This is a correct version of reinforced stacking.
vali8.py generating prediction for the validation set, series 7 and 8 for each subject.

vali8sub.py generating prediction for the test set.

vali8 uses future features, so vali8sub itself is not a legit model

vali8 uses channel 2 for filtering

note that vali7 also uses future features, the wrong one is stack7

stack8 fixed the problem of stack7
